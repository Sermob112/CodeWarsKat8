# Clock shows h hours, m minutes and s seconds after midnight.
#
# Your task is to write a function which returns the time since midnight in milliseconds.
#
# Example:
# h = 0
# m = 1
# s = 1
#
# result = 61000
# def past(h, m, s):
#     hm = h * 60 * 60 * 1000
#     mm = m * 60 * 1000
#     sm = s * 1000
#     sum = hm + mm + sm
#     return sum
#
# print(past(0,1,1))
